# Data Directory 
The data files are stored in the data directory and contain both raw and tidy / processed data.
In the data folder there will be subdirectories splitting the raw and the tidied data. 

This data is treated as a 'read-only' and no substitutions to the data will be made to these files. If changes are required as a last resort, a new file will be created with a second file listing all the changes made in order that they were made.
