Questions to ask Dr Mara:
  
1. Players with two listed positions. How to split the column and keep a position?
3. 
4. 
5. 

NOTES:
When attempting to judge how good a team will be in the standings, offensive rating is key. 
The most successful teams in 2018-19 all had stellar offensive ratings. Defensive rating, while not as important as its offensive counterpart, can also provide a strong indication of a team’s W-L record. 
These all-encompassing numbers will usually dictate how a team’s season will turn out.
Efficiency matters more than attempts for both overall shots and 3-point shots. The value of a 3-point attempt is more than a regular field goal attempt and shooting a better percentage from behind the arc means more in today’s NBA.
Rebounding differential is more important than a strong assist/turnover ratio. The margin in the latter statistic might be too small to create a difference in the standings. Dominate the boards, however, and you’re more likely to see a positive impact. Pace is largely irrelevant.
But at the end of the season, these stats all contribute to the two numbers that matter most: wins and losses.


GO BACK AND FIX IN TIDY DATA
1. If required to remove players secondary position. (Create new column or remove and replace with a single position_dodge)


NEXT ON TO DO LIST:
SINGLE LINEAR REGRESSION:
  
ggplot
correlation
linear regression model for position specific analysis
predict values
detect outliers - hat values - cooks distance - dealing with any?
Durbin Watson test
Homoscedasticity


MULTIPLE LINEAR REGRESSION:

Confounding variables using pairs
conf.int model
predict using above model
linearity using avplots
multicollineariy using variance inflation factor

Create the expected points, assists and rebounds based on if all players are exactly the same. Must be position specific though
Then select player according to their value on salary
