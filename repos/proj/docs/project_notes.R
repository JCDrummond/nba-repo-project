NOTES:
When attempting to judge how good a team will be in the standings, offensive rating is key. 
The most successful teams in 2018-19 all had stellar offensive ratings. Defensive rating, while not as important as its offensive counterpart, can also provide a strong indication of a team’s W-L record. 
These all-encompassing numbers will usually dictate how a team’s season will turn out.
Efficiency matters more than attempts for both overall shots and 3-point shots. The value of a 3-point attempt is more than a regular field goal attempt and shooting a better percentage from behind the arc means more in today’s NBA.
Rebounding differential is more important than a strong assist/turnover ratio. The margin in the latter statistic might be too small to create a difference in the standings. Dominate the boards, however, and you’re more likely to see a positive impact. Pace is largely irrelevant.
But at the end of the season, these stats all contribute to the two numbers that matter most: wins and losses.

Bulls averaged 104.94 points per game last season with the league average being 111.21 points per game
