## Overview 

This assessment task allows you to consolidate and apply the concepts and skills you've learnt throughout the semester. This assessment requires you to generate a **reproducible data analysis project.** 

Your reproducible data analysis project will be hosted as a repository on GitHub and you are required to submit the URL to your GitHub repository.

## Scenario and Aim of the Data Analysis Project

You are a data analyst with the Chicago Bulls competing in the NBA (national basketball association). In the most recent NBA season (2018-19), your team placed 27th out of 30 (for win-loss record). Your team's budget for player contracts next season  is $118 million, ranked 26th out of 30 (for the purpose of this assignment, next season is 2019-20). For context, the team with the highest payroll budget is Portland with $148 million, while the best performing team was Milwaukee Bucks (who clinched the best league record in 2018-19 [who clinched the best league record in 2018-29](https://www.espn.com/nba/standings/_/season/2019/group/league)) with $131 million. 

You have been tasked by the general manager of Chicago Bulls to find the best five starting players [one from each position](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball_positions)) your team can afford. (Make sure you don't use up all of your money on just these five players, you still need to fill a full team roster, but are just focussed on finding five starting players here). You can choose players that are already playing for Chicago Bulls, you just need to prove that they are worth it.

library(broom)
library(dplyr)

## Data source

We have been provided the following data sets:
1. 2018-19_nba_player-statistics.csv :  sourced from [basketball-reference.com](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2019_totals.html)

2. 2018-19_nba_player-salaries.csv :  sourced from [hoopshype.com/salaries](https://hoopshype.com/salaries/)

3. 2019-20_nba_team-payroll.csv : sourced from [hoopshype.com/salaries](https://hoopshype.com/salaries/)

4. 2018-19_nba_team-statistics_1.csv : sourced from [basketball-reference.com](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2019.html)

5. 2018-19_nba_team-statistics_2.csv : sourced from [basketball-reference.com](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2019.html)

## Read Data (Correct)

Read in the various files using the `read_csv()` function from the `readr` package. 

```{r read}
p_stats <- read_csv("data/raw/2018-19_nba_player_statistics.csv")
p_sal <- read_csv("data/raw/2018-19_nba_player-salaries.csv")
team_stats <- read_csv("data/raw/2018-19_nba_team_statistics_1.csv")
team_stats_2 <- read_csv("data/raw/2018-19_nba_team_statistics_2.csv")
payroll <- read_csv("data/raw/2019-20_nba_team-payroll.csv")
```

## Tidying Data Process (Correct) 

1. Rename the variables.
```{r rename} 
#Rename the variables to remove % and variables starting with numbers
p_stats <- rename(p_stats,
                  FGp = 'FG%', x3P = '3P', x3PA = '3PA', x3Pp = '3P%', x2P = '2P', x2PA = '2PA', x2Pp = '2P%', eFGp = 'eFG%', FTp = 'FT%') 
team_stats <- rename(team_stats,
                     x3PAr = '3PAr', TSp = 'TS%', eFGp = 'eFG%', TOVp = 'TOV%', ORBp = 'ORB%', DRBp = 'DRB%')
team_stats_2 <- rename(team_stats_2,
                       FGp = 'FG%', x3P = '3P', x3PA = '3PA', x3Pp = '3P%', x2P = '2P', x2PA = '2PA', x2Pp = '2P%', FTp = 'FT%')
```

## Dealing with NAs

```{r na-replace-remove}
#Replace the NAs found in shooting percentage of players who didn't attempt a particular shot
p_stats <- p_stats %>%
  mutate_if(is.numeric, funs(ifelse(is.na(.), 0, .)))
#Remove the NA columns added at the end of the Salary and Team Stats variables
p_sal <- p_sal[,-(4:7), drop = FALSE] # Removed columns 4 through to 7 that displayed no data
team_stats <- team_stats[, -(23:25), drop = FALSE] # Removed columns 23 through to 25 that displayed no data

```

## Joining data frames

```{r salary-player-join}
p_sal <- subset(p_sal, select = c(2:3)) # First remove player id as not required data

p_stats <- right_join(x = p_stats, y = p_sal) # This will join the salary to the respective Player

p_stats <- drop_na(p_stats) # We're able to see that players salaries may have been included that either did not play through injury, retirement or sent to another league but remained in the salary cap. We remove these players from our list

which(is.na(players_data), arr.ind = TRUE) # Quick test to identify if any NAs remain in the dataset
```

## Reorder Columns (Correct when we join Salary to the main data)

```{r reorder-salary}
players_data <- players_data[, c(1,2,3,4,30,5:29)] # Move the salary variable into a more logical position in the table
players_data <- rename(players_data, Salary = 'salary') # Rename salary to Salary, to tidy up the appearance slightly.
```

## Filtering Data and Removing Duplicates (Correct filtering and removal of duplicates)

```{r filter-mins-g}
players_data <- players_data %>%
  filter(G >= 20, MP >= 100) # Filter out and remove players that haven't played enough and who's data could influence decisions unnecessarily.  

players_data <- players_data %>%
  group_by(player_name) %>%
  arrange(player_name, desc(G)) %>%
  distinct(player_name, .keep_all = TRUE) # Will remove any duplicate players based on the amount of games played in that row. The highest amount of games played for the duplicated remains. Team variable 'TOT' stands for Two or More Teams so that is the row we want to keep.

print(players_data)
```

## Removing accents and periods (Needs alteration)

```{r removing-accents}
x <- stringi::stri_trans_general(p_stats$player_name, "Latin-ASCII")
 # Saves the player name list in new variable. Removes the accents and saves as a character vector

x_new <- as.data.frame(x, row.names = NULL, optional = FALSE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE) # Converts the vector into a single column data frame

x_new <- stringr::str_replace_all(x_new$x, pattern = "\\.", replacement = "") # Removes the periods in players names.

x_new <- as.data.frame(x, row.names = NULL, optional = FALSE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE) # Converts the vector into a single column data frame

x_new <- rename(x_new, player_name = 'x') # Changes column name to merge data frames

p_stats <- bind_cols(x = x_new, y = p_stats) # Combines the no accent name variable to the main data frame. 

p_stats <- subset(p_stats, select = -c(player_name1)) # Removes the player name variable that had the accents.
```

## Transforming the Data 
#### New variables

```{r new-variables}
p_stats <- p_stats %>%
  group_by(Pos) %>%
  mutate(FTpm = FT / MP,
         BLKpm = BLK / MP,
         ASTpm = AST / MP,
         STLpm = STL / MP,
         TOVpm = TOV / MP,
         x3Ppm = x3P / MP,
         PPG = PTS / G,
         APG = AST / G,
         RPG = TRB / G) # Creates new variables at the end of our data frame

p_stats <- format.data.frame(p_stats, digits = 3) # Rounds the new variables to 3 decimals places 

p_stats <- arrange(p_stats, Pos) # Arranges the data frame in order of Position
```
